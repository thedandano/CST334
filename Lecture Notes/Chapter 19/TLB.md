# CHAPTER 19: PAGING: FASTER TRANSLATIONS (TLBs)

- Chopping up addresses into fixed sized units (pages) requires a lare amount of mapping information 

- Mapping information is generally stored in physical memory, paging logically required nan extra memory looup for each cirtual address generated by the program 

---

## THE CRUX: HOW TO SPEED UP ADDRESS TRANSLATIONS

1. How can we speed up address translation, and genrallt avoud the extra meory reference that paging seems to require?

2.  What hardware support us required?

3. What OS involvement is needed?

---

- To speed things up sometimes the use of the hardware is needed 

- To speed up address translation we are going to add a translation lookaside buffer (TLB). 

- A TLB is part of the chip's memory-management unit (MMU) and is simply a hardware cache of popular cirtual-to-physical address translations; thus a better name would be an address-translation cache

- Uponi each virtual memory referemce, the hardware first checks the TLB to see if the desired transltion is held therein

- If so, the translation is performed quickly qithout having to consilt the page table  (which has all of the translations)

- TLBs make the virtual memory possible

```C
//LINE 1
int vpn = (virtualAddress && vpn_mask) >> shift
```

- Line 1 extract the VPN from the virtual address and checks if the TLB holds the translation for this VPN in line 2

```C
//LINE 2
(success, TLB entry) = TLB_Lookup(VPN)
```

- If it does, then we have a TLB hit, which means the TLB holds the translation
