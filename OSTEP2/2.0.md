# While a program runs {#intro}

- Processor fetches an instruction from memory

- Processor decodes (figures out which instruction this is)

- Processor executes (does its thing: add two numbers, access mem, check condition, etc.)

- Basics of Von Neumann model;

## Operating System {#OS}

- A body of software that is responsible for making programs easy to run many at a time, allows programs to share memory, interact with devices, and is in charge of making sure the system operates correctly and efficiently in an easy-to-use-manner  

## Virtualization {#virtualization}

- The primary method used by operating systems to make them easy to use

- Using physical resources ( the processor, memory, disk) and transforms it into more general, powerful and easy to use **_virtual_** form of itself  

- Thus, OS are sometimes referred to as a **_virtual machine_**

## System Calls {#system-calls}

- In order to allow users to tell the OS what to do, thus making use of the virtual machine(i.e. running a program, accessing a file),
the OS provices APIs that one can call

- A typical OS exports a few hundred **system calls** that are available to applications.

- OS provides these calls to run programs, access memory, and devices: it is said then that the OS provides a **_standard library_** to applications.
